    "Our final answer can be determined by counting amongst these possibilities. **If we stay with the original choice, we win a prize in 3/8 scenarios, for a 37.5% probability. If we change, however, we will win a prize in 4/8 scenarios, for a 50% probability. Therefore, our best strategy, when Monty Hall can open a door, is to switch doors to increase our chances of winning.** Unfortunately, this still only leaves a 50/50 shot at best, which is slightly worse than the original Monty Hall Problem.
