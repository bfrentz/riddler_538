# Problem:
"""
I have 10 chocolates in a bag: Two are milk chocolate, while the other eight are dark chocolate. One at a time, I randomly pull chocolates from the bag and eat them â€” that is, until I pick a chocolate of the other kind. When I get to the other type of chocolate, I put it back in the bag and draw again with the remaining chocolates. I don't stop until I have eaten all 10 chocolates.

For example, if I first pull out a dark chocolate, I eat it. (I always eat the first chocolate I pulled out.) If I pull out a second dark chocolate, I eat that as well. If the third one is milk chocolate, I do not eat it (yet), and instead put it back in the bag. Then I start again, eating the first chocolate I pull out.

What are the chances that the last chocolate I eat will be milk chocolate?
